# Policy Gigabrain

Centralized intelligence system for government affairs. Generates meeting briefers, tracks staffers and legislators, monitors legislation, predicts votes, and surfaces portfolio-relevant regulatory actions.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Policy Explainer Index

**Before answering ANY policy or regulatory question — before running web searches or reading external sources — you MUST first check the Paradigm Policy team's internal analysis.**

```bash
call gsuite docs_read '{"doc_id":"1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c"}'
```

This is the **Policy Explainer Index** ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c/edit?tab=t.0)), maintained by the Policy team. It contains Paradigm's internal analysis and takes on major regulatory developments (GENIUS Act, FDIC rulemakings, SEC actions, etc.).

**Why this matters:** The Policy team's analysis includes Paradigm-specific context, portfolio impact assessments, and strategic framing that external sources cannot provide. External web searches should only supplement — never replace — the team's own work.

**Workflow:**
1. Read the Policy Explainer Index to check if the topic has been analyzed
2. If an explainer exists, read the linked analysis doc for full detail
3. Pull recent posts from **#gigabrain-feed** for additional policy intel:
   ```bash
   call slack get_channel_history '{"channel":"C0AM0TR8N91","limit":50}'
   ```
4. Only then supplement with external sources (OCC/SEC/CFTC websites, Federal Register, etc.) if needed
5. Always cite the internal analysis as the primary source

## Workflows

### 1. Meeting Briefer Generation

Generate a policy briefing memo before Hill meetings.

**Trigger Phrases** (from Madison, Alex G., Justin, Stefan, Katie, or Caitlin):
- "Write a policy briefing memo for [Name, Title]"
- "Briefing memo for [Name]"
- "Policy briefer for [Name]"
- "Meeting brief for [Name]"

**Input:** Member/staffer name, meeting context, date

**Steps:**
1. Look up member profile via web search (committee assignments, voting history, public statements)
2. Search internal sources for prior Paradigm interactions:
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"from:#policy [member_name]"}'
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"in:#gigabrain-feed [member_name]"}'
   call gsuite gmail_search '{"query":"[member_name]"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"[member_name]"}'
   ```
3. Find relevant pending legislation:
   ```bash
   call congress bills '{"congress":119}'
   call congress bill '{"congress":119,"type":"s","number":123}'
   ```
4. Check FEC for campaign contribution context:
   ```bash
   call openfec candidates '{"name":"[member_name]"}'
   call openfec contributions '{"contributor_name":"[member_name]"}'
   ```
5. Cross-reference with paradigmdb for portfolio company relevance:
   ```bash
   call paradigmdb db_query '{"query":"SELECT * FROM \"Organization\" WHERE name ILIKE '\''%relevant_company%'\'';"}'
   ```
6. Generate structured briefer (see template below)

**Briefer Template:**
```
# Policy Briefing Memo: [Name, Title]
Date: [DATE] | Location: [LOCATION]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview: who we're meeting, why it matters, and our primary objective.]

## Background
Write 1-2 paragraphs in full sentences covering: their current role and title, committee assignments, party and state, what they are currently prioritizing, key legislation they sponsor or co-sponsor, and any prior Paradigm interactions or touchpoints.

## Biography
Write 1-2 paragraphs in full sentences covering: key career milestones (Hill tenure, private sector, executive branch experience), education and alma mater, notable past and present committee or subcommittee positions, leadership roles, and relevant personal context such as state/district dynamics, known interests, or relationship dynamics.

## Crypto Knowledge
Write 1-2 paragraphs in full sentences covering: their overall familiarity level with crypto and digital assets, notable public statements or positions on crypto, DeFi, or stablecoins, relevant votes on crypto or fintech legislation, and the sophistication level of key staffers covering crypto and tech policy.

## Stance on Prediction Markets
Write 5-7 sentences covering: (1) the member's general opinion of prediction markets (public statements, letters signed, bills sponsored or co-sponsored); (2) relevant current events such as prediction market bills introduced, CFTC rulemakings, or court cases (e.g., Kalshi litigation); (3) whether those current events are likely to shift the member's position; and (4) any constituent, state, or district considerations that could influence their stance — including state gambling revenue, tribal gaming interests, state gambling laws, DGE/gaming commission enforcement actions, and the competitive dynamics between CFTC-regulated event contracts and state-licensed sportsbooks. Frame the analysis around Paradigm's position that prediction markets and all event contracts (including sports betting) should be regulated by the CFTC under exclusive federal jurisdiction.

## Goals
- **Primary Ask:** [What we want from this meeting]
- **Secondary Objectives:** [Relationship-building goals, intel to gather, positions to reinforce]
- **Success Criteria:** [How we'll know the meeting went well]

## Specific Topics To Address
1. [Topic 1 — context, our position, and suggested framing]
2. [Topic 2 — context, our position, and suggested framing]
3. [Topic 3 — context, our position, and suggested framing]
[Add as many as needed based on the meeting agenda and current legislative landscape]

## Natural Language Queries

The system should answer questions like:

- "What is Senator X's likely position on the GENIUS Act and why?"
- "Which bills introduced this session could affect our stablecoin portfolio companies?"
- "Who are the key staffers on Senate Banking covering crypto?"
- "What have we heard about stablecoin reserve requirements in the last 90 days?"
- "Generate a briefer for my meeting with Rep Y tomorrow"
- "What is the current whip count on [bill]?"
- "Which states have introduced DeFi-related bills this year?"

## Example Session

**User:** Policy briefer for Senator Lummis — meeting tomorrow about stablecoin legislation.

**Agent:**
1. Read Policy Explainer Index first for internal analysis
2. Pull recent #gigabrain-feed posts for stablecoin intel:
   ```bash
   call slack get_channel_history '{"channel":"C0AM0TR8N91","limit":50}'
   ```
3. Web search for Senator Lummis profile, recent statements, committee assignments
4. Search internal sources:
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"in:#gigabrain-feed Lummis"}'
