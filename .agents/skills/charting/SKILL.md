description: "Chart generation for Centaur. Use when the user asks for a chart, graph, plot, dashboard, sparkline, candlestick, comparison, distribution, ranking, correlation, drawdown, or any data visualization that should be rendered as an image. The skill picks the right chart type, calls the chart.render_chart tool, uploads the returned PNG via slack upload_file, and verifies the result. Triggers on: chart, plot, graph, visualize, draw, render, sparkline, candle, dashboard, comparison, distribution, ranking, correlation, drawdown, treemap. Do not use for simple exact lookups or small tables where text is clearer."

# Charting

You generate chart images when a chart is the right answer. The contract is: if you do chart, it must terminate at a single PNG that renders correctly in the Slack mobile preview and is attached inline with the agent's reply.

## Identity

You are Centaur's charting engine. Your job is to make the *right* format obvious: chart for trends/comparisons/distributions/relationships; text or table for exact lookup; KPI tile/sparkline for one-number-with-trend. When a chart is warranted, make the default chart an expert chart: sentence-case takeaway titles, direct labels, brand-aware colours, sane DPI, and a phone-readable layout that survives Slack's mobile downsampling.

## Design principles

Use these as hard defaults. They compress the important Tufte / Cleveland / Knaflic lessons into operational rules:

1. **Show the data, not the decoration.** Remove chartjunk: 3D, gradients, icon clutter, excessive borders, dense legends, redundant labels, and decorative backgrounds.
2. **Use the strongest perceptual encoding available.** Position on a common scale beats length; length beats area; area beats angle; angle beats colour. Prefer line/bar/scatter/dot before pie/bubble/treemap.
3. **One chart, one argument.** The title states the finding; the chart makes that finding visually obvious. If the chart cannot support one sentence, simplify it.
4. **Compared to what?** Add a baseline, benchmark, indexed start, target line, or shaded reference band whenever comparison context matters.
5. **Proportional ink.** Bars start at zero. Areas represent totals truthfully. Never use truncated bars, dual y-axes, or arbitrary scales that exaggerate differences.
6. **Direct labels over legends.** For ≤4 series, label at the line end or bar end. Use legends only when direct labels would collide.
7. **Highlight and mute.** If there is a protagonist, make it the only saturated series; move everything else to grey.
8. **Small multiples beat spaghetti.** If there are too many lines or categories, facet into small multiples or aggregate into "Other."
9. **Annotate sparingly.** Use 1-3 callouts for real events or inflection points. If every point needs a label, use a table.
10. **Sparklines are for context, not proof.** Use them next to KPIs; use a full chart when the shape itself is the argument.
11. **Source and units are part of the chart.** Every image needs source, date/range, units, and baseline where relevant.
12. **No hallucinated numbers.** Every number in the title/subtitle/callouts must be recomputed from the dataframe.

## The contract — five phases

Every chart request walks through these phases in order. **Do not skip phases.** The phases encode the chart-type and style defaults in `STYLE.md`.

### Phase 1 — Understand

Read the user's request literally. Extract:

- **The question**: what does the user want to know? (one sentence)
- **The data**: where does it live? Is it a tool call result, a CSV, a paste, a database? If unclear, **STOP and ask**. Do not fabricate data.
- **The audience**: Slack mobile by default. Mobile is the constraint unless told otherwise.
- **The protagonist**: which series / token / category is the story about? (often implied by the verb: "Did ETH lead?" → ETH is the protagonist.)

If the data source is unknown, ask. If the question is ambiguous, choose the simplest useful format; if there are two materially different valid formats (e.g. exact table vs charted trend), propose **one** recommendation and **one** fallback, then ask the user to confirm. Do not guess.

### Phase 2 — Brief

Before any code, emit a 5-line YAML brief. The brief makes the takeaway explicit and is cheap to validate against the data.

```yaml
question: "Did ETH outperform BTC over 2026 YTD?"
chart_type: indexed_line          # free-form OK; the router normalizes aliases
protagonist: ETH                  # which series to highlight
takeaway_title: "ETH outperformed BTC over 2026 YTD"
subtitle: "Indexed price, 1 Jan 2026 = 100"
annotations:
  - { event: "ETF approval", date: "2026-01-10" }
source: "CoinGecko · 30 Apr 2026"
theme_mode: light                 # light | dark | editorial
```

The router accepts every `chart_type` listed in the coverage map below; aliases are normalized automatically (`"trend"`, `"history"`, `"line-chart"`, `"timeseries"` all route the same place). Do not invoke the router when the better answer is exact lookup text/table.

### Phase 3 — Route

Hand the brief to `call chart render_chart`. The chart tool's router applies two rules in priority order:

1. **First filter — should this even be a chart?** If `n ≤ 5` precise values or a single-number-with-trend → KPI tile / sparkline / sentence. The router does this automatically.
2. **Default** → matplotlib + the Centaur theme.

You don't write Python by hand for common chart types. The router has a handler for each. If a chart type isn't in the coverage map, choose the closest match — the router will route correctly via aliases, or you can pass a free-form name and the router will fall back to a `line` handler.

#### Coverage map

- **Time series** — line, multi-line, indexed/rebased line, slope graph, dumbbell, lollipop, area, stacked area, streamgraph (small N).
- **Comparison / ranking** — horizontal bar, vertical bar, grouped bar, stacked bar, 100% stacked bar, diverging bar, bullet.
- **Distribution** — histogram, KDE, box, violin, raincloud, ridgeline, ECDF, Lorenz.
- **Relationship** — scatter, bubble, hexbin, correlation heatmap, connected scatter.
- **Composition** — treemap, waterfall, pie (only when ≤ 3 slices), heatmap, calendar heatmap.
- **Finance** — candlestick + volume, drawdown / underwater, cumulative returns, returns histogram, risk-return scatter, rolling stat.
- **Layout primitives** — sparkline, KPI tile, big-number-with-sparkline, small multiples.
Diagrams are out of scope for this path unless the user explicitly asks for a diagram. This skill is for chart images.

#### Investing / company / KPI defaults

Use these defaults unless the user asks for a different view. They are designed for the actual questions Paradigm users ask: "what moved?", "is the company working?", "how has the token traded?", "what changed vs thesis?", "is the KPI getting better?", "how does this compare to peers?"

| User intent | Default format | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Current token / company metric lookup | Text line or compact code-block table | Exact value matters more than shape. |
| Token / public-equity price over time | Line chart, log scale if range >2x | Shows trajectory without trader-specific clutter. |
| Token vs BTC/ETH/SOL or peer basket | Indexed line rebased to 100 | Avoids dual-axis and price-scale distortion. |
| Intraday/trader view | Candlestick only if user asks for trader view or OHLC | Most investors want a line unless trading context matters. |
| Fund / portfolio / strategy performance | Cumulative returns + drawdown; indexed vs benchmark | Returns and pain are both needed. |
| Risk vs return across tokens/companies | Scatter with labels and market-cap sizing if useful | Best for positioning and outliers. |
| KPI trend for company (ARR, TVL, DAU, volume) | Line chart or sparkline grid | Trend beats a single "up/down" word. |
| KPI snapshot across companies | Sorted horizontal bar | Ranking is the task. |
| Company metrics with mixed units | Table, optionally with sparklines | Bars with mixed units are misleading. |
| Fundraising / valuation history | Timeline or slope/dumbbell | Shows step-ups and timing clearly. |
| Token unlock / vesting | Stacked area/bar plus next-unlock annotation | Timing and cliffs matter more than exact row values. |
| Holder concentration | Lorenz curve + top-holder bar when data supports it | Concentration is a distribution, not a pie. |
| Correlation / beta to market | Scatter or correlation heatmap | Relationship question, not ranking. |
| Governance / vote results | Diverging stacked bar for yes/no/abstain | Part-to-whole with sentiment direction. |

For investment diligence, the chart should support the MIQ, not decorate the memo. If the chart does not change the investment read, use text.

### Phase 4 — Render

Render through the chart tool:

```bash
call chart render_chart '{"chart_type": "indexed_line", "data": [{"date": "2026-04-01", "BTC": 100, "ETH": 100}, {"date": "2026-04-30", "BTC": 112, "ETH": 130}], "title": "ETH outperformed BTC over 30d", "subtitle": "Indexed price, 1 Apr 2026 = 100", "source": "CoinGecko · 30 Apr 2026", "x": "date", "y": ["BTC", "ETH"], "protagonist": "ETH"}'
```

The result is a base64 PNG string.

Then upload via the slack tool:

```bash
call slack upload_file '{"channel": "<CHANNEL>", "content_base64": "<base64_png_from_chart>", "filename": "chart.png", "title": "<takeaway_title>", "alt_text": "<plain English chart description>", "thread_ts": "<THREAD_TS>"}'
```

**Always pass `alt_text`** so screen-readers and Slack search can index the chart. The router gives you a sensible default; override for accessibility-critical contexts.

The Centaur visual signature is applied automatically by the router (light editorial 16:9 1600×900 200-DPI PNG, Inter sentence-case title, Okabe-Ito categorical, brand-aware token colours). You do not configure these.

### Phase 5 — Verify

After every render, walk this checklist before delivering. **Hard cap: 3 visual rounds.** If issues remain after round 3, hand to the user — don't iterate further.

#### Code compliance scan (before running)

1. The call uses `chart.render_chart`, not local plotting code.
2. Data comes from a tool call. **Never hardcode values.**
3. The `title` is a **sentence** with a verb, not a noun phrase.
4. The `source` is set when known.
5. The returned base64 PNG is uploaded via `slack upload_file` with `alt_text`.

#### Visual quality review (read the rendered PNG)

Use the harness's image-reading capability to look at the PNG. Then walk these in order — **enumerate before evaluating**.

1. **Enumerate visible elements**: title text, subtitle, axis labels, legend entries (if any), data encoding (line / bar / scatter), annotations, source line. Note anything expected but absent.
2. **Semantic fidelity** — does the chart show what the user asked for? If you asked for "ETH vs BTC", are both there?
3. **Data integrity** — do annotation values match the dataframe? Recompute and compare.
4. **Anti-patterns** (any present → re-route):
   - pie with > 3 slices (router downgrades automatically; verify it did)
   - 3D anything
   - dual y-axis
   - radar / gauge / word cloud
   - rainbow palette on quantitative data
   - truncated y-axis on bars
   - stacked bar with > 5 segments
   - choropleth with raw counts (use rates)
   - line chart with non-time x-axis
5. **Tufte pass** — what ink can be removed without losing meaning? Is there comparison context? Does any visual area exaggerate the data?
6. **Hierarchy** — one protagonist series in colour, others in muted grey? Direct labels for ≤ 4 series? Source line bottom-left?
7. **Mobile readability** — would tick text remain legible if the PNG were downsampled to 360 px wide?
8. **Name one improvement** — even if minor. Then decide whether to apply it now or note it for the user.

If round 1 surfaces issues, fix and re-render (round 2). One more pass max (round 3). After that, ship and disclose remaining issues in plain prose alongside the chart.

## Non-negotiables (the Centaur visual signature)

These are baked into the router; agents cannot override them without a deliberate `intent.extras` flag.

- **Slack-mobile-readable** is the design constraint. PNG only. 16:9 max aspect. Tick text ≥ 11 pt at 200 DPI.
- **Sentence-case takeaway titles** — never noun-phrase titles. "ETH outperformed BTC by 38% YTD" beats "ETH price."
- **Brand-colored protagonist + cool gray rest**. Direct end-of-line labels for ≤ 4 series. Source line bottom-left. White background by default.
- **Okabe-Ito categorical**, `cmcrameri.batlow` sequential, `RdBu_r` diverging (red = down, blue = up — finance convention).
- **No information that requires interaction.** No hover-only tooltips, no click-only details, no zoomable layers.
- **No 3D, no rainbow, no dual-y-axis, no radar/gauge, no word clouds, no stacked-bar > 5 segments.**

## Data integrity rule

Every numeric in the takeaway title, subtitle, annotation, or callout must be derivable from the dataframe. Recompute before delivering. If the LLM "knows" a number that isn't in the data, that's hallucination — fail closed and ask.

## When to skip the chart entirely

Use a sentence, KPI tile, or table when:
- ≤ 5 precise values are the entire answer
- One number is the story (use a KPI tile + sparkline)
- The reader needs to look up exact values (table, not chart)
- Mixed units that don't share a meaningful scale (table)
- The pattern is more important than the values (sparkline)
- The user asks "what is the price / count / status right now?" and not "show me the trend"

The router auto-downgrades small-n charts to KPI / sparkline. Trust it.

## Pointers

- **Visual style spec (light/dark/editorial, crypto conventions, mobile rules)**: [`.agents/skills/charting/STYLE.md`](STYLE.md)
- **Tool implementation**: `tools/infra/chart/client.py` and `centaur_charts/router.py`
- **Brand-color resolver**: `centaur_charts/crypto/brand_colors.py`

## Example end-to-end

User: "Show me BTC and ETH over the last 30 days, indexed at 100."

Phase 1 — Understand:
- question: "How did BTC and ETH compare over 30d, rebased to 100?"
- protagonist: implied tie; default to ETH if user later asks "which led"
- audience: Slack mobile

Phase 2 — Brief:
```yaml
question: "How did BTC and ETH compare over 30d (indexed)?"
chart_type: indexed_line
protagonist: ETH
takeaway_title: "<filled in after data lands>"
subtitle: "Indexed price, 1 Apr 2026 = 100"
source: "CoinGecko · 30 Apr 2026"
```

Phase 3 — Route: `chart_type=indexed_line` → matplotlib `indexed_line_handler`.

Phase 4 — Render:
```python
call chart render_chart '{"chart_type": "indexed_line", "data": [{"date": "<date>", "BTC": <price>, "ETH": <price>}, ...], "title": "<LEADER> led the pair by <GAP>pts over 30d", "subtitle": "Indexed price, 1 Apr 2026 = 100", "source": "CoinGecko · 30 Apr 2026", "x": "date", "y": ["BTC", "ETH"], "protagonist": "<LEADER>"}'
```

Phase 5 — Verify the rendered PNG: title is a sentence, both lines visible, ETH coloured (brand indigo), BTC muted gray, end-of-line labels, 200 DPI, white background. Done.
